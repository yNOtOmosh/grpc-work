gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is an open-source Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework developed by Google. It enables communication between services in a distributed system, allowing applications to talk to each other efficiently, regardless of the language or platform they are built on.

Here are the key points about gRPC:
Protocol:
gRPC uses HTTP/2 as its transport protocol. This gives it features like multiplexing (multiple requests on a single connection), bidirectional streaming, flow control, and efficient connection usage.
Serialization:
It typically uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for data serialization. Protobuf is fast, compact, and language-neutral, which makes communication efficient.
Cross-platform & Multi-language:
gRPC supports many programming languages (e.g., Go, Java, Python, C#, Node.js, etc.), making it ideal for microservices architectures where services may be written in different languages.
Types of communication:
gRPC supports multiple types of service calls:
Unary RPC – client sends one request, server returns one response.
Server streaming RPC – client sends one request, server streams multiple responses.
Client streaming RPC – client streams multiple requests, server sends one response.
Bidirectional streaming RPC – both client and server send streams of messages to each other.

Use Cases:
Microservices communication
Real-time messaging
Connecting mobile/IoT clients to backend services
